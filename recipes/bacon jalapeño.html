    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        These jalapeño poppers are creamy in the middle with crispy bacon on the outside.
         They're easy to make and taste so much better than traditional poppers.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup cream cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>12 jalapeno peppers, halved lengthwise, seeds and membranes removed</li>
        <li>12 slices bacon</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Mix cream cheese and Cheddar cheese together in a bowl until evenly blended.
             Fill each jalapeño half with cheese mixture. Put halves back together and wrap each stuffed pepper with a slice of bacon.
             Arrange bacon-wrapped peppers on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bacon is crispy, 25 to 35 minutes.</li>
